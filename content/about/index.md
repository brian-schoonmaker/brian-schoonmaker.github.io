I am a full-stack web developer passionate about solving problems.

I started my coding journey building a C# / ASP.NET interface for visualizing data collected from automated hospital beds.

I pivoted to building web apps using the LAMP/WAMP/XAMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP).

Later I used Groovy / Kotlin code in combination with complicated sequences of SQL queries to power an analysis platform for insurance data on the backend, along with an Angular based frontend.

I've developed APIs in Python in multiple frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, etc.) to power capabilities within the energy industry, as well as Javascript / React apps to interact with the APIs on the frontend.

That transitioned into a role handling Authorization / Identity across the organization, and building / supporting the infrastucture needed to facilitate that.

I've dabbled in C++, Java, Ruby and Visual Basic.

I've preferred dynamic languages like Python until recently, but that position seems to change the more I build in GO.

In every argument I've ever had, what I hope for more than anything is to be proven wrong so unequivocally that my entire mindset changes.
